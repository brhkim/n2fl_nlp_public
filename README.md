# n2fl_nlp_public
This is the public-facing code repository for the N2FL NLP paper by Brian Heseung Kim, Katharine Meyer, and Alice Choe. The purpose of this repository is for demonstration and illustration purposes only; while we would ideally be able to publicly release all requisite data files and allow for complete reproduction by any interested parties, the data files contain PII and thus the analysis is not actually reproducible by the public. Even so, we have released our code with only minor adjustments (to protect the identities of partner institutions) for future reference, as the code may nonetheless be useful for other researchers attempting to examine trends and engagement patterns within mass texting contexts.

More information is available in our public working paper. If you would like to know more, have questions, or would otherwise like to get in touch, please send an email to Brian Heseung Kim at brhkim@gmail.com
